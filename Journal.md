I made the schematic for my design. It has two battery sources, one 9V and one 5V. I have an OLED-120064D and a servo connected to three buttons (one for start, one for reset, and one for stop). Everything is wired to the arduino nano. The 9V is for the nano and the 5V is for the servo. 

I learned the difference between SPI and I2C. SPI is good for constant streams of changing data, but I2C is better for slower communication over two wires, but it is much easier to wire.

I also started on the CAD. I got all of the different electrical components and started putting them together in one file and arranging them as I think I will on the actual design. I might use a breadboard though, as that would be much easier to design around to get the components to fit. I will have to see.
