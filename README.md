Podomoro Timer Desk Assistant

This project is a Podomoro timer with a spinning servo like a kitchen timer that moves in according to Podomoro phase and time. There is an OLED screen to show the focus stage and buttons to start, reset, and stop. 

I made this because I love using the Podomoro timer website and I think it would be super cool to have my own physical example of it. It would also be a cool thing to have on my desk while studying, and I want to learn how to control a servo.
